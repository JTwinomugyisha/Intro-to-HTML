    <p>I am a tech-driven professional with a growing specialization in cybersecurity and digital systems. With a background in customer support and talent management, I have consistently integrated technology into my work whether it's using CRM tools to streamline service delivery or leveraging data systems to track job placements and mentorship outcomes. My interest in cybersecurity has led me to pursue certifications such as CyberSafe Foundation, Cyber Threat Intelligence 101, ITIL 4, and CompTIA Linux+, all of which have deepened my understanding of secure digital environments and IT operations.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as a Talent Management Officer at Refactory Academy, where I help aspiring tech professionals transition from training to employment. In this role, I collaborate with the training team to align the curriculum with evolving industry demands, including the growing need for cybersecurity skills. My focus is not only on helping graduates find jobs but also on preparing them to thrive in secure, technology-driven workplaces.</p>
    <p>My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between talent development and cybersecurity awareness, especially in emerging markets. Iam passionate about building digital resilience among tech professionals and organizations by promoting cybersecurity best practices and fostering a culture of continuous learning. I see technology not just as a tool, but as a space where safety, innovation, and opportunity must coexist.</p>
